OCR test

Some files to test OCR. tale.png is a simple file. columntest.jpg comes from an old Bible and it is arranged in 4 columns. The idea is to 'read' the inner two columns ignoring the 'chuff'. An interesting thing about these old Bibles is that the text is formatted. At various places in the text one may find regular text, italics text, smallcaps, and black letter. One can also see the vintage typeography where the lower case 's' is sometimes represented with a 'long s'. All of these formats and the vintage typeography may be represented in unicode directly. This is illustrated in the file Bible_1769_text.txt. Of course how nice the file looks in a text editor depends on the font you use. I find the JuliaMono font works pretty well.
