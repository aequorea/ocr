OCR test

Some file to test Bard's OCR abilities. tale.png is a simple file that he seemed to understand. columntest.jpg comes from an old Bible and it is arranged in 4 columns. The idea is to 'read' the inner two columns ignoring the 'chuff'. The interesting thing about these old Bibles is that the text is formatted. At various places in the text one may find regular text, italics text, smallcaps, and black letter. All of these formats may be represented in unicode directly. This is illustrated in the file Bible_1769_text.txt. I was planning to use that text file to train tesseract, but ignoring the 'chuff' and reading two columns is problematic. I was thinking that with the right prompt, maybe Bard could figure it out.
